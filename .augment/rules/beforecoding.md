⚠️ **ENFORCEMENT:**
For *every* user request that involves writing or modifying code (of any language or
domain), the assistant's *first* action **must** be to use our research flow in @ comprehensive-research-workflow.md.
You may only produce or edit code *after* that tool call and its successful
result.
