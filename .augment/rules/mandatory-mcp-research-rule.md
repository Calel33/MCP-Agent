# 🚨 MANDATORY MCP RESEARCH RULE - BEFORE ANY CODE

## 📋 Rule Overview

This rule ensures that all code generation is based on thorough research using available MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools. It prevents hallucinations, ensures best practices, and maintains code quality by requiring research before implementation.

## ⚠️ ENFORCEMENT PROTOCOL

For **EVERY** user request involving writing, modifying, or generating code (any language, any domain):

### STEP 1: MANDATORY MCP TOOL RESEARCH
**BEFORE** writing ANY code, you **MUST** call appropriate MCP research tools:

### 🎯 GOAL-ORIENTED RESEARCH REQUIREMENT
**CRITICAL**: All research must conclude by directly addressing the user's stated goal. Research that doesn't connect back to the goal is incomplete.

#### 🔍 Research Tool Selection Guide (CRITICAL: Each Tool Has Specific Purpose):

##### **Archon MCP Tools** - PROJECT-SPECIFIC Research
- **Purpose**: Search within YOUR project's knowledge base and integrated sources
- **Best For**: Patterns you've implemented, tech stack you're using, project-specific examples
- **Sources**: Your integrated documentation (shadcn/ui, Next.js docs, libraries you use)
- **Tools**:
  - `search_code_examples()` - Find patterns in YOUR integrated sources
  - `perform_rag_query()` - Query YOUR project-specific documentation
  - `get_available_sources()` - See what sources you actually have
  - `manage_project()` - Get project context and requirements
  - `manage_task()` - Check current tasks and priorities
- **❌ NOT For**: Generic programming tutorials, broad "how-to" guides, general best practices

**Use When**: Need project-specific patterns, integration with your tech stack, your existing implementations

##### **GitHub/Grep MCP Tools** - EXTERNAL Pattern Discovery
- **Purpose**: Find real-world implementations across the broader ecosystem
- **Best For**: Discovering new patterns, seeing how others solve problems, quality examples
- **Sources**: Public repositories, open-source projects, community implementations
- **Tools**:
  - `searchGitHub_grep()` - Find patterns in quality repositories
  - `githubSearchCode_octocode()` - Search specific organizations/repos
  - `githubGetFileContent_octocode()` - Examine specific implementations
  - `githubSearchRepositories_octocode()` - Find relevant repositories
  - `packageSearch_octocode()` - Research NPM/Python packages
- **✅ Perfect For**: Generic programming patterns, industry best practices, external validation

**Use When**: Need real-world examples, library usage patterns, discovering new approaches

##### **Docfork MCP Tools** - OFFICIAL Library Documentation
- **Purpose**: Fetch up-to-date official documentation for any open-source library
- **Best For**: Official docs, installation guides, topic-focused information, code examples from maintainers
- **How It Works**: Uses `author/library` format (e.g., "vercel/next.js", "shadcn-ui/ui")
- **Sources**: Official documentation sites for open-source libraries
- **Tools**:
  - `get-library-docs_docfork()` - Fetch official docs with optional topic focus
- **✅ Perfect For**: Installation guides, authentication setup, routing examples, official best practices

**Use When**: Need official documentation, setup guides, or topic-specific information from library maintainers

### STEP 2: RESEARCH REQUIREMENTS

You **MUST** research the following before any code generation:

#### 🎯 Core Research Areas:
1. **Existing Patterns**: How similar functionality is implemented in the project/ecosystem
2. **Best Practices**: Industry standards, security considerations, performance patterns
3. **API Usage**: Correct syntax, parameters, configuration options
4. **Dependencies**: Required packages, versions, and proper installation methods
5. **Architecture**: How new code integrates with existing structure
6. **Error Handling**: Common failure modes and proper error management
7. **Testing**: How to properly test the implementation

#### 📊 Research Depth Requirements:
- **High-Level**: Architecture patterns, design principles, security considerations
- **Mid-Level**: Library APIs, configuration options, integration patterns
- **Low-Level**: Specific syntax, parameter usage, method signatures

### STEP 3: VALIDATION CHECKLIST

Before proceeding to code generation, verify:

- [ ] **Research Tools Called**: Appropriate MCP tools used successfully
- [ ] **Goal Alignment**: Research directly addresses the user's stated goal
- [ ] **Patterns Found**: Relevant implementation patterns discovered
- [ ] **Best Practices Identified**: Security, performance, and quality standards understood
- [ ] **Dependencies Verified**: Required packages and versions confirmed
- [ ] **Integration Planned**: Approach for fitting into existing codebase defined
- [ ] **Error Handling Considered**: Failure modes and error management planned
- [ ] **Testing Strategy**: Approach for validating implementation determined
- [ ] **Goal Achievement Path**: Clear connection from research findings to goal completion

### STEP 4: ONLY THEN GENERATE CODE

After successful research and validation, proceed with:

1. **Implementation**: Code based on researched patterns and best practices
2. **Integration**: Proper connection with existing architecture
3. **Error Handling**: Robust error management based on research
4. **Documentation**: Comments and docs following discovered standards
5. **Testing**: Test implementation based on researched testing patterns

## 🚫 VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES

### Absolutely Prohibited:
- ❌ **NO CODE** without prior MCP research
- ❌ **NO ASSUMPTIONS** about APIs, syntax, or patterns
- ❌ **NO HALLUCINATED** functions, methods, or configurations
- ❌ **NO SHORTCUTS** - research is mandatory for ALL code requests
- ❌ **NO OUTDATED PATTERNS** - verify current best practices

### Required Actions:
- ✅ **ALWAYS** call MCP tools first
- ✅ **VERIFY** all API usage through research
- ✅ **FOLLOW** discovered patterns and best practices
- ✅ **INTEGRATE** properly with existing codebase
- ✅ **DOCUMENT** research findings and decisions

1. **Document the limitation** clearly
2. **Use conservative, well-known patterns** only
3. **Add extensive comments** explaining assumptions
4. **Recommend verification** once tools are available
5. **Prioritize safety** over functionality

### Minimal Viable Research:
If tools return limited results:
1. **Broaden search terms** and retry
2. **Search for related concepts**
3. **Document knowledge gaps**
4. **Use most conservative approach**
5. **Plan for future research**

1. Did I call MCP research tools before writing code?
2. Did I find relevant patterns and examples?
3. Did I understand the security implications?
4. Did I verify API usage and syntax?
5. Did I plan for proper integration?
6. Did I consider error handling and testing?

### Quality Assurance:
- Review research findings before implementation
- Cross-reference multiple sources when possible
